1, I like frameworks, but I hate when I have to abandon them

2, I wish they do less rather than to too much. It will force me to learn how to do things in the most fundamental ways.

3, I wish refactoring happens later.

4, I wish I can really separate the concerns completely. That means I can do this while not disrupting other parts of the projects. And I can connect them easily.

5, For each part of the concern, you can learn how to do it redundantly. Then you teach me how to do it in a way that reduce my work.

6, Do Less, Learn Less, change frameworks quickly.
