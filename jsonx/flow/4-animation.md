### animation: natural repaint logic ( kind of like based on physics laws )

1. animation is simply the change of frames

2. how to tween these frames is up to us to define.

3. animation is the detail we don't care but expected to happen as default.

4. not like event, we think it as a new attention seeker.

   Here is the take, imagine you are a cave person. style is not natural.

   Animation is natural, since the world is move by default.

   Animation is the extension of styling, but also unobtrusive.

5. `event` is changes that deserves our attention and interaction.
