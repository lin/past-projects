1. `class` is reserved, and css use `class`

2. `.title` is not a valid named variable because of `.`.

3. `btn-blue` is not a valid named variable because of `-`.

4. `<div>Hello <em>World</em></div>` the text node is added explicitly.

5. `try { }; return { }` is reserved.

6. String have to be quoted. But you have to quote string, or you quote function.

I found the latter is not reasonable. The first is just annoying for beginner.

---

1. change  `class` to `className` or `clas`, both annoying, I know

2. change `background-color` to `backgroundColor`

3. change `-ms-text-shadow` to `__msTextShadow` (two `_`)

4. change `.title` to `_title` (one `_`), change `.` to `_`

you can prefer clarification over verbose.

you can also prefer brevity over confusing.
