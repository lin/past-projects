1. how to bind data with view, so it reduces the code dramatically.

2. how to randomly access the data from the source of truth.

Two things:

1. you have to understand how to bind var to data

2. you have to be able to access this

3. structure is needed when you add events

4. you must make common tasks easier.

balance between

Currently, I think the workflow through a pipeline.

1. define the structure with relative reference and class name

2. define the stable styling which tear apart from class norm.

3. define the props if itself is also a class need to be abstracted.

4. define the in or out or effects animation. Morph itself.

5. define EventListeners.

ready to ship!

Any components is a product, and a product is produced in a pipeline to reduce its complexity while making.

So the process of coding is defining or making a product.

We have a wood or logic gates initially, then we chop a little to have a rough picture of this.

1. styling stage. gives it self a reference name.

   CSS is done by separate factory. not it the pipeline

2. animation stage. (click in out effect, morphing shape stage)

   ```javascript
    notification.on.in = function() {};
   ```

3. events stage.

   in out effects events, are animation events, we can separate that up.

   then it goes to non natural events. which make them the most complex defining part of one app.
